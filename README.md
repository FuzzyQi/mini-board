# Mini-Board

This is a sample mini message board built with the MEN stack (MongoDB, Express, NodeJs).   
It works like a dumbed down Twitter Clone where there are only "tweets".  

It supports the CRUD operations.  
There is authorization and authentication using cookies and sessions.   

## Live on Heroku
The app is live [here](https://rhine-mini-board.herokuapp.com) on Heruku.
